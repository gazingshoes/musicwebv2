Project Pemdas,

Musicify, a terminal music player, all using python!

Follow the instructions in the Main Menu, there's already a provided list of songs, if you'd like to edit, add, or remove songs you can do it manually in 'songs.txt', but if you want to do it while running the program, there's a feature for it too!

Sorry, no playlist feature yet.
